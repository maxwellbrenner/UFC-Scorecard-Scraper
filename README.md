## Project Functionality

This project provides software to scrape official UFC event scorecard images from the [UFC.com](https://www.ufc.com/) website. It organizes these images by event, downloads them, and compiles them into PDFs for each event. This allows easy access to official scorecards for fans, analysts, and researchers interested in fight results and judges' decisions.

The script is structured to capture links to events, navigate to scorecards, filter out unnecessary content, and manage pagination on the results page. It has several modular functions to ensure effective navigation and data organization.

### 1. Event Results and Scorecards

The program begins by visiting the [UFC Results Page](https://www.ufc.com/results?language_content_entity=en), gathering the list of recent events. It extracts:
- **Event Link**: URL to each event's main result page.
- **Event Filter**: Processes links to ensure only unique and relevant scorecards are captured.

Each event's page is then accessed to collect specific scorecard links, bypassing pages for weigh-ins, bonus announcements, and other non-scorecard-related content.

### 2. Image Downloading and PDF Creation

For each scorecard link, the program downloads official UFC scorecard images:
- **Image Filtering**: Selects images hosted on UFCâ€™s CDN (dmxg5wxfqgb4u.cloudfront.net) for accuracy.
- **PDF Compilation**: All downloaded images for each event are compiled into a single PDF. The file is named based on the event details, and the PDFs are stored in a structured directory.

### 3. Redundancy and Manual Link Handling

To improve data accuracy, the script:
- **Removes Redundant Links**: Filters out unnecessary and duplicate URLs by comparing link identifiers.
- **Adds Manual Links**: Includes any official scorecard links not automatically captured in the scraping process, providing a comprehensive set of scorecards.

### 4. Folder Checking and PDF Creation for Existing Images

To maintain a complete set of PDFs, the script checks for folders without a PDF and creates one if necessary:
- **Folder Verification**: Identifies folders missing a PDF file.
- **Image PDF Creation**: Compiles available images within each folder into a PDF if one does not already exist.

### Requirements

The script requires the following Python packages:
- `requests`: For HTTP requests to the UFC Results page.
- `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4`: To parse and extract HTML content.
- `re`: For regular expression-based URL filtering.
- `os`: For managing local directories and file paths.
- `img2pdf`: To compile downloaded images into PDFs.

### Setup and Execution

1. **Install Required Packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4 img2pdf
    ```
   
2. **Run the Script**:
    Execute the script by running:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

This will begin the scraping process, organizing scorecards by event, downloading images, and compiling PDFs.

### Folder Structure and File Naming

- **Event Folders**: Each event has a designated folder (`event_[number]_[event_name]`) within `ufc_images/`, organizing images by event.
- **PDF Files**: PDFs for each event are named with the event number and name, e.g., `1_ufc_308_topuria_vs_holloway.pdf`.

### Notes

This script is designed to handle any future UFC events published on [UFC.com](https://www.ufc.com/). It can be updated with new manual links if needed to ensure a comprehensive collection.
