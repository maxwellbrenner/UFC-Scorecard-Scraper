## Overview of the `main()` Function

The `main()` function orchestrates the scraping process by following these steps:

1. **Collect Event Links**: The `find_results_links()` function gathers links to recent UFC events by scraping the UFC results page. It filters out links irrelevant to fight results (like weigh-ins) and handles pagination to access all available events.

2. **Identify Scorecard Links**: For each event, `find_event_scorecard_links()` extracts links to the official scorecards. If no direct link to scorecards is available, it searches the event page to locate any embedded "official scorecard" links.

3. **Download and Compile Scorecard Images**: The `download_images_from_event_scorecard_link_and_create_pdf()` function processes each scorecard link, downloading images and compiling them into a PDF, named by event. Images are saved in folders structured by event for easy navigation.

4. **Check for Missing PDFs**: After processing, the `find_folders_without_pdfs()` function identifies any event folders missing PDFs, ensuring completeness in case of download errors.

5. **Manual PDF Creation**: If any images are missing PDFs, `create_pdf_from_images()` manually generates a PDF from all images in a specified folder, providing a fallback if the automated process encounters issues.

By the end of `main()`, the program has organized and stored scorecards from multiple events, ensuring a comprehensive dataset of official UFC scorecards.

 - **Returns**: A list of URLs linking to individual event results pages.

### 5. `find_event_scorecard_links(results_links)`  
 - **Description**: Processes each event link to identify scorecard links. If no explicit scorecard link exists, it visits the page and finds any "official scorecard" links within.  
 - **Returns**: A list of URLs that contain scorecards for each event.

### 6. `remove_redundant_links(event_scorecard_links)`  
 - **Description**: Cleans up the scorecard links list by removing duplicates or links with unnecessary query parameters. This function is critical to ensure clean, non-redundant data.  
 - **Returns**: Two lists — one with cleaned links and another with redundant links removed.

### 7. `add_manual_event_scorecard_links(existing_links, manual_links)`  
 - **Description**: Adds manually identified scorecard links that may have been missed in automated scraping, ensuring each link is added only once.  
 - **Returns**: A combined list of existing and manual links, avoiding duplicates.

### 8. `parse_folder_name_from_event_scorecard_link(event_scorecard_link)`  
 - **Description**: Generates a valid folder name from a scorecard link by converting hyphens to underscores and removing invalid characters.  
 - **Returns**: A formatted folder name string.

### 9. `download_images_from_event_scorecard_link_and_create_pdf(event_scorecard_link, event_index)`  
 - **Description**: Scrapes and downloads images from a given scorecard link, stores them in a specific folder, and compiles the images into a PDF.  
 - **Returns**: Creates a folder with images and a PDF file for the event scorecard if successful.

### 10. `image_processing(event_scorecard_links, starting_event_number=1, ending_event_number=None)`
- **Description**: Processes a specified range of event scorecard links by downloading images and creating PDFs for each. The starting and ending parameters allow for processing a subset of events as needed.
- **Returns**: Downloads images and creates PDFs within designated folders for each processed event.

### 11. `find_folders_without_pdfs(parent_directory)`  
 - **Description**: Checks each subdirectory within a parent directory and identifies folders that do not contain a PDF file.  
 - **Returns**: A list of folder names without PDFs.

### 12. `create_pdf_from_images(folder_path)`  
 - **Description**: Creates a PDF file from all `.jpg` or `.jpeg` images within a specified folder. Used to manually compile PDFs if the automated process fails.  
 - **Returns**: A PDF file if images exist, otherwise outputs an error message.

## Execution Flow

The `main()` function initiates the scraping process, collecting event links, identifying scorecard links, downloading images, and creating PDFs. Finally, it verifies completeness by checking each folder for a corresponding PDF. This function ensures the entire workflow runs smoothly from data collection to output organization.

### 1. Collect Event Links

The scraper begins by retrieving event links from the UFC results page using `find_results_links()`. It filters out non-fight links (such as weigh-ins or bonus announcements) and processes pagination to ensure comprehensive data collection.

![UFC Scorecard - Results Page](https://github.com/maxwellbrenner/UFC-Scorecard-Scraper/raw/main/images%20(UFC.com)/UFC%20Scorecard%20-%20Results%20Page.png)

- **Description**: The results page lists completed UFC events, each linking to individual event pages.
- **Function**: `find_results_links()` collects links to relevant fight events.

---

### 2. Identify Scorecard Links

With event links gathered, the program uses `find_event_scorecard_links()` to locate links to official scorecards. For events without direct scorecard links, it parses the event pages to extract embedded "official scorecard" links.

![UFC Scorecard - Load More](https://github.com/maxwellbrenner/UFC-Scorecard-Scraper/raw/main/images%20(UFC.com)/UFC%20Scorecard%20-%20Load%20More.png)

- **Description**: The "Load More" button on the UFC results page allows for accessing older events, facilitating data retrieval for larger datasets.
- **Function**: `find_event_scorecard_links()` gathers all event-specific scorecard links.

---

### 3. Process Event Pages for Scorecards

The program processes each event page to verify scorecard links. If a scorecard link is available, it is saved directly; otherwise, the program scans the page for an "Official Scorecard" link.

![UFC Scorecard - Event Page](https://github.com/maxwellbrenner/UFC-Scorecard-Scraper/raw/main/images%20(UFC.com)/UFC%20Scorecard%20-%20Event%20Page.png)

- **Description**: Each event row on the event page allows for accessing main and preliminary fight results.
- **Function**: The scraper identifies specific scorecards for each event.

---

### 4. Download and Compile Scorecard Images

Using the scorecard links, `download_images_from_event_scorecard_link_and_create_pdf()` downloads each event’s scorecard images and compiles them into a PDF.

- **Description**: The scorecard images are stored in organized folders by event, ensuring easy navigation and future reference.
- **Function**: The scraper downloads images and compiles a PDF for each event’s scorecard.

---

### 5. Verify Scorecards and Create Missing PDFs

Once all scorecard images are downloaded, `find_folders_without_pdfs()` checks each folder for PDFs, identifying any events that may be missing them. `create_pdf_from_images()` can then manually generate PDFs from available images.

- **Description**: This step verifies that all scorecards have PDFs for easy access and analysis.
- **Function**: Ensures every event has a corresponding scorecard PDF, with manual creation for any missing PDFs.
